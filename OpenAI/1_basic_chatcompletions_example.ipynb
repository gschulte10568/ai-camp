    "Chat models are a class of GPT models that take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output. All newer GPT models released by OpenAI are chat models, including GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 (which are used in ChatGPT). In this notebook, we will show how to use these models to generate chat completions."

She is best known for her pioneering research on radioactivity, which led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry). Her groundbreaking work laid the foundation for many advancements in the field of nuclear physics and medicine. Curie's contributions to science and her perseverance in the face of gender discrimination have made her an inspirational figure for generations.\n"
